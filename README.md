## This game was made entirely with web technologies.
[ HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Three.JS/WEBGPU - 3D engine, Rapier - Physics engine ]. . . 
and a lot of sleepless nights.

If you are interested in running this project yourself you'll need to have node and pnpm installed on your machine. 
In the root directory run `pnpm install` and then `pnpm run dev`
I plan to deploy this in the future to a public web address.
